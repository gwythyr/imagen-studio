## For Developers

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Database**: SQL.js with absurd-sql for persistence
- **AI Integration**: Google Generative AI SDK
- **Storage**: Local browser SQLite with BLOB support

### Architecture

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/           # TypeScript interfaces
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/             # Database and API utilities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/      # React components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/           # Helper functions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.tsx         # Application entry point
```

### Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run preview  # Preview production build
npm run lint     # Run ESLint
```

### Key Patterns

- Store chat messages and images as BLOBs in SQLite
- Use crypto.randomUUID() for message/session IDs
- Direct Gemini API calls from browser
- Custom hooks with subscriptions for reactive SQLite data
- No try/catch blocks - let errors bubble up naturally

### Database Schema

SQLite with local persistence:
- **Sessions**: Chat session metadata and settings
- **Messages**: Individual messages with BLOB image support
- **Generated Assets**: Images stored as BLOBs with metadata

### Contributing

1. Follow existing architectural patterns
2. Maintain separation of concerns (no mapping in services)
3. Use defined TypeScript interfaces (no inline types)
4. Keep components focused on single responsibility
5. Test with `npm run dev` before submitting
